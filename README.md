## Pages

### Home Page

### Contact Page

It also features a contact form with fields for name, email, phone number, subject, and message. The form is functional and integrated with the FormSubmit API to send submissions directly to a designated Gmail address.

## Features

### Responsive Design

The website is optimized for responsiveness, ensuring it adapts to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This is achieved through the use of flexible grid layouts, media queries, and responsive images.

### FormSubmit API Integration

The contact form on the Contact page is integrated with the FormSubmit API. When users submit the form, their data is securely sent to a designated Gmail address. This integration ensures that inquiries are handled efficiently and professionally.

## Technologies Used

The FitFusion website utilizes the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The structure of the web pages is built using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), providing the foundation for content presentation.

- **CSS (Bootstrap)**: Styling and layout are achieved using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), with the Bootstrap framework being used for pre-designed CSS components and utilities. This ensures a visually appealing and responsive design.

- **JavaScript (jQuery)**: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website, enhancing user experience. jQuery, a JavaScript library, is specifically employed for functionalities such as navbar toggling.

- **FormSubmit API**: The website integrates the FormSubmit API to handle form submissions. This API enables the submission of form data to a designated email address securely.

These technologies collectively contribute to the creation of a modern, responsive, and interactive website for FitFusion.
